# sucker-cli

> An Unofficial Pushover Client and Daemon

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
npm install -g sucker-cli
```

## Note: This is mainly for my personal use and was thrown together without much regard for others. If someone would like to make contributions to make this more robust, I'm very open to that but don't expect much in way of support for now
